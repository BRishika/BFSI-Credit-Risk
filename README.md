Business Goals:

Building a strong predictive model for Loss Given Default (LGD) with respect to defaulted accounts is the main goal. The percentage of risk that is not recoverable for a lender following a borrower's default is known as the leveraged loss (LGD). For risk management and financial planning to be effective, accurate LGD prediction is essential.

Performance Evaluation: Using a specified performance indicator in line with corporate objectives, evaluate the prediction model's efficacy. This assessment ought to precisely determine how well the model predicts LGD.

Gain a thorough understanding of the variables, data types, and distributions included in the offered data sets. It is essential to understand each variable's significance for LGD prediction in order to build a relevant and precise model.

Data Aggregation and Fusion: To improve the predictive power of the model, combine and aggregate relevant data from the dataset. The combined data ought to provide thorough insights into the variables affecting LGD.

Data Types and Quality: To avoid mistakes resulting from data type inconsistencies, make sure that variable data types are accurately identified. Clean up and preprocess the data, taking care of any errors or missing variables that could negatively affect the model's performance.

Feature Engineering and Extraction: Utilize feature engineering and extraction techniques to produce novel variables that can augment the prediction power of the model. To improve the accuracy of the LGD prediction, add characteristics that capture the nuances of defaulted accounts.
